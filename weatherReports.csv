Tornado,"This tornado started on the southwest side of Dermott just west of Buckner Lane. Here several trees were snapped. As it crossed Buckner, six power poles were taken down. It then crossed Trotter Street, where more trees were snapped with others uprooted. A fence was laid down as well. A few homes here had minor roof damage where shingles were blown off. The tornado then tracked across US Highway 165 where it moved through open field. It tracked into the South Delta Regional Correctional Facility. Quite a bit of damage was done to the facility as it took a direct hit. Several large sections of the outer fence were torn down. Five buildings on the south side of the complex sustained roof damage where shingles and sheet paper were removed. The gym building, a metal structure, was heavily damaged where a large section of wall was removed. The main building of the complex suffered roof damage where roughly half of the roof was lifted or had parts removed. The roof is not a typical roof, it has several layers. Large portions of the foam insulation were pulled out along with several sections of a thin roof covering. A couple of the guard watch towers had the windows blown out and some minor damage. One employee was injured trying to exit a tower and broke a leg. The tornado then moved into a wooded area, where trees were snapped and a metal carport was thrown and destroyed. As the tornado crossed Highway 35, many more trees were damaged. One home sustained minor roof damage on the south side of the highway. The tornado crossed US Highway 65 and snapped more trees. It then continued through a large wooded area and farmland and it moved into Desha County. It then crossed Highway 159 where many more trees were snapped and uprooted. Where it crossed Highway 159, a home sustained some minor roof damage and had the wood framed shed destroyed. A few power lines were down here as well. The tornado continued northeast into a wooded area where more trees were damaged. Though the tornado likely dissipated a bit farther east, no access was available to that area due to flooding.

Tornado,"A weak non-supercell EF0 tornado occurred Friday April 22, 2016 at around 4 pm associated with a line of showers along the leading edge of a cold front. Due to its non-supercell status, it will be referred to as a landspout, but is in the family of tornados.||Friday evening, 22 April, the Monterey WFO WCM was informed by a local TV meteorologist of a video posted to facebook showing a possible tornado or dust devil. The video was posted by and on the KRKC, Greenfield radio station, facebook page. Through the course of the evening of the 22nd and morning of the 23rd, the MTR WCM and WFO staff continued investigation through following up with the reporting TV meteorologist and reaching out to KRKC via facebook and email. By Saturday morning the 23rd the address and point of contact at the storm location was obtained and a storm survey was initiated.||The WFO MTR WCM was dispatched Saturday morning to perform a storm survey. The storm survey was done through the use of the Damage Assessment Toolkit (DAT) on the office iPad. Interviews were also conducted of eyewitnesses as part of the survey.|The visual survey was done with the help of an eyewitness who described where the landspout began, the path it took, damage it inflicted, and provided the visual confirmation of rotation. According to multiple accounts, the landspout began on the hillside NW of a small farm community, laying nearly flat a broad oak tree. As the landspout moved down the hill it likely went through a period of vortex stretching, allowing it to tighten up and spin a bit faster. Eyewitnesses say the landspout moved down off the hill and toward several small houses. It displaced two normal sized steel dumpsters about 30 yards in the direction of its travel. Along this flat land portion of the path the landspout encountered two oak trees, tearing off several large branches (3in diameter) and depositing them 20-30 yards away in a downpath direction. Damage assessment indicates the landspout weakened significantly while passing over several small housing structures and brushing by a barn. Once past these structures it encountered another downhill slope and re-intensified. The landspout then encountered a pole barn with a small to moderate size trailer parked beneath. There were no visible signs of damage to the trailer, but the pole barn showed significant roof damage. It is estimated that about half of the roof from the pole barn was damaged or torn off with this debris strewn about the area. Rotation is easily confirmed due to debris locations. Parts of the roof were thrown orthogonally to the right of the direction of movement, as far as 40 to 50 yards. Other portions of the roof were lifted up, taken with the landspout and scattered across a neighboring vineyard. The farthest deposit away from the pole barn is estimated at about 60 to 80 yards, along the landspout path to the southeast. Eyewitness video posted on KRKC facebook page shows the landspout at the far edge of the vineyard and entering a rapid dissipation phase.||Eyewitness accounts also included the following:.|No significant winds outside of the landspout.|Ears popping as the landspout passed.|A palette spinning in the air in the landspout???s early phase.|No palette was found and no damage from the palette was reported.|Thunder was heard in the area preceding the landspout.|Brief intense heavy rain followed the landspout.|One person reported two distinct circulations, one that descended from the cloud base and another that followed which spun up off the ground.||Atmospheric and observation conditions included:.|Occurred along the leading edge of a passing cold front.|Cloud bases were estimated from eyewitness video to be around 5kft.|Radar showed showers in the area.|Lowest angle of radar beam was at about 9-10kft over the area.|Appears to be a case of low topped convection which is normal for the immediate west coast.|Wind data in the area did not show significant speeds."

Excessive Heat,"Unusually strong high pressure aloft developed across Arizona during the middle of June, beginning Saturday June 18th and persisting into next week. The strong high pressure, combined with dry air and sunny skies, led to very dangerous heat across the greater Phoenix area on Sunday June 19th. An Excessive Heat Warning was in effect starting at 1000MST and continuing through the evening hours, the high temperature in Phoenix reached 118 degrees which set a new record for the date. This dangerous heat led to the death of a mountain biker in the Phoenix Mountain Preserve during the morning hours. According to spokesman Captain Larry Subervi of the Phoenix Fire Department, fire crews responded to reports of an adult with heat related issues about 1 mile from the Desert Vista Trailhead shortly before 0900MST. This was in the area near Interstate 17 and Jomax Road. The 28 year old woman, a personal trainer, had set out biking on the trail with two friends at about 0600MST and they all had water. Shortly before 0900MST, her friends - who are doctors - started CPR and called 911. She soon stopped breathing. Crews reached the woman about 0930MST and continued to provide aid while airlifting her to the parking lot where an ambulance awaited. According to Captain Subervi, she was transported to a local emergency room in extremely critical condition and she lost her pulse due to the exhaustion. He indicated that there were no other injuries and her condition was 100 percent heat-related illness. The woman, who was an experience biker, became tired in the heat and told her friends that she could not continue before gaining an altered mental status. Tom Grace, a technician on the helicopter that airlifted her off the trail, said that the operation was one of the riskiest types of rescues performed by the department due to the heat and the location of the woman."

Excessive Heat,"Very strong high pressure aloft developed across Arizona during the middle of June 2016, beginning on Saturday June 18th and persisting into early next week. In combination with dry air and sunny skies, the strong high pressure led to the development of dangerous heat across the lower central deserts. The high temperature for the day was 111 at Phoenix and although an Excessive Heat Warning was not yet in effect, heat impact level data suggested that borderline warning conditions had already developed across the greater Phoenix area and northern Pinal county. According to the Pinal County Sheriff's Office, a 25 year old man died while hiking on the Peralta Trail in Gold Canyon during the afternoon hours on June 18th. The victim died as a result of exposure to extreme heat, search and rescue teams were called out to the trail just after 1330MST. According to the Sheriff's Office, a friend told deputies that the victim started hiking at 0730MST for what was to be a day hike, unfortunately he ran out of water after just a few hours. Shortly thereafter he exhibited signs of heat illness and the friend called 911 for help. The man's condition continued to get worse, he lost consciousness and never recovered. This was just one of three heat-related emergency calls within a four hour period on Saturday in the Superstition wilderness. The other two victims ended up with just minor heat-related injuries."

Tornado,"Emergency management officials surveyed an area of wind damage in southern, rural Winter Garden and provided observations and photos to the NWS. In addition, several citizens provided valuable data and at least one person reported seeing a funnel cloud to his south shortly before the onset of damage. A path of damage occurred from the northern portion of the Orange County National Golf Center grounds, northward for 1.5 miles, paralleling Highway 429, just to the east. Significant tree was noted along Porter Road, and along both sides of Hamlin Groves Trail. Over 100 trees were damaged along the path (falling in a convergent pattern), including dozens of pine trees which were snapped several feet above the ground and many others which were uprooted. The path continued northward where five newly built homes on Bowman Drive were damaged. A pool screen enclosure and fences were damaged and a few homes experienced soffit, window and air conditioning unit damage from flying debris. Some debris was carried just north of New Independence Parkway, with no significant damage noted farther north. A review of all available data strongly suggested the damage was a result of a short-track, EF-0 tornado, with maximum winds estimated at 80 to 85 mph. DI1, DOD1, UB, DI28, DOD3, EXP, DI28, DOD4, LB."
Tornado,"Emergency Management officials provided detailed wind damage reports which occurred along a 4.35 mile long south-to-north path from Fruitland Park to Lady Lake, parallel to and just west of U.S. Highway 441. The damage consisted mainly of downed trees, branches and powerlines, although two homes in Lady Lake sustained structural damage due to falling trees. The most significant damage occurred on the east side of the tornado track, due to the rapid storm motion of 60 mph. The discontinuous damage path began near the College Avenue and W Miller Street in Fruitland Park and ended in Lady Lake, about midway between the Recreation Plantation RV Resort and Highway 441.  A review of all available data suggests that the wind damage was likely the result of a EF-0 tornado (winds estimated 70-75 mph). Isolated tree damage south and north of the tornado track was likely due to strong straight-line winds associated with the cell. DI2, DOD1, EXP, DI27, DOD2, EXP, DI27, DOD3, LB."

Flash Flood,Shortly after midnight on the 10th a cluster of thunderstorms moved over lakeshore Erie County. The storm peaked right over the city of Erie and Millcreek around 1240 am with rainfall rates measured at 6 per hour.
